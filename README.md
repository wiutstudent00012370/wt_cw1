This site represents the hospital service organization. It has 6 pages. In this site you can find location of this hospital and location its different branches. In this site you can also book appoinment with doctors. In addition you can leave your questions and reccomendations. Also in this site you can find a page where you can see partners of this hospital. For developing this site I have used html, css, and Java script. I used css to make this site look better. I have added different backgrounds that will change smoothly. Moreover, I have used Java Script for form validation and to make pages interactive.
